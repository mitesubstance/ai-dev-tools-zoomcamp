# Context7 Library IDs (local registry)

This file is a lightweight, local “cheat sheet” for **Context7-compatible library IDs**.

Use these IDs in prompts to skip the library matching step:

```text
use context7
use library /org/project
```

## Libraries

| Topic / Library | Context7 Library ID |
|---|---|
| Conventional Commits | `/websites/conventionalcommits` |
| FastMCP (Python) | `/jlowin/fastmcp` |
